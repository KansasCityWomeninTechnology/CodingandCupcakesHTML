  Unordered Lists and List Items
  HTML lists allow web developers to make visual lists on webpages.
  There are two kinds of lists, ordered lists and unordered lists.
  Ordered lists are lists that are numbered.
  Unordered lists are lists with circle bullet points.

  To use unordered lists, use the tag <ul>.
  To use an ordered list, use the tag <ol>.

  List items are the part that you see on the screen.
  This is how you add items to your ordered or unordered list.
  Inside of the <ol> or <ul> tag, use the <li> tag to define each list item.

  The below list items are used to create hyperlinks to redirect your screen between
  our index page, or "home" page and our "contact" page.

  -->

<ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <!-- Make your own list item here that connects to your contact.html page -->
     
</ul>

<!-- 
    Titles are the text on your tab in a web browser like Google Chrome.
    When you preview your project you should be able to see the tab text reflect your title.
-->
<title>Coding and Cupcakes HTML</title>
</head>

<!-- 
    Headings are defined with tags(<>) in the format of h(#)
    Whatever number comes after h in the tag determines
    the importance of the heading relative to other headings.
    h1 defines the most important heading.
    h6 defines the least important heading. 
-->

<!-- 
    Paragraphs are defined with the p tag(<>) and are where
    you should be writing large bodies of text on your webpage. 
-->

<body>
<dir align="center">

<h1 >My First Heading</h1>

<p> My <b>First</b> Paragraph! </p>

<!-- 
    Html has elements you can use to make text more interesting.
    The element used in the p tag above, the <b> tag, bolds words inside of the tag.

    A few other elements can be used as well such as:
    <i> (italics)
    <em> (emphasis, effect is also italics)
    <small> (smaller text)
    <mark> (highlight)
    <del> (deleted text, will appear marked through)
    <ins> (often used for inserted text, will appear underlined)
    

    Don't forget your closing tags!
-->



<!-- Note that the heading here is <h2> -->
<!-- <h2> is smaller than <h1> but larger than <h3>-<h6> -->
<h2>My Second Heading</h2>

<!-- 
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.
    Alternative text is used by screen readers for those that can't see the image, to briefly explain the image.

    Replace the image name that's in quotes after src="assets/" with whichever of the provided
    images you prefer and have uploaded from the Google Drive Folder into the assets folder of
    this project. You can also resize the image by changing the width and height attributes.
-->
<img src="assets/No Image Available.svg" alt="No Image Available" width="104" height="142">
<img src="assets/No Image Available.svg" alt="No Image Available" width="104" height="142">
<img src="assets/No Image Available.svg" alt="No Image Available" width="104" height="142">

<dir align="center">
<br>
<!-- Below is what's called a hyperlink. -->
<a href="https://kcwomenintech.org/" target="_blank"> KC Women in Technology </a>
<!-- 
     The <a> tag, or anchor tag, is used to begin a hyperlink. 
     The href attribute is where the url you want your hyperlink to go to will live.
     The target="_blank" attribute makes sure that the link is opened in a new tab 
     instead of redirecting your current page to the link url.
