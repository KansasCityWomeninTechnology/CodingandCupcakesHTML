<!-- Every html document you create will require the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the very top,
     and the <html></html> tag right below. 
     
     All of your code for the page/document will reside inside of the <html> opening and closing tags.

  Unordered Lists and List Items
  HTML lists allow web developers to make visual lists on webpages.
  There are two kinds of lists, ordered lists and unordered lists.
  Ordered lists are lists that are numbered.
  Unordered lists are lists with circle bullet points.

  To use unordered lists, use the tag <ul>.
  To use an ordered list, use the tag <ol>.

  List items are the part that you see on the screen.
  This is how you add items to your ordered or unordered list.
  Inside of the <ol> or <ul> tag, use the <li> tag to define each list item.

  The below list items are used to create hyperlinks to redirect your screen between
  our index page, or "home" page and our "contact" page.
  Basically, this unordered list serves as a navigation bar between our two pages we'll have.

  -->

  <!-- Unordered List Below (read above for explanation) -->
<ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <!-- Make your own list item here that connects to your contact.html page -->
</ul>

<!-- 
    Titles are the text on your tab in a web browser like Google Chrome.
    When you preview your project you should be able to see the tab text reflect your title.
-->
<title>Coding and Cupcakes HTML</title>
</head>

<!-- 
    Headings are defined with tags(<>) in the format of h(#)
    Whatever number comes after h in the tag determines
    the importance of the heading relative to other headings.
    h1 defines the most important heading.
    h6 defines the least important heading. 
-->

<!-- 
    Paragraphs are defined with the p tag(<>) and are where
    you should be writing large bodies of text on your webpage. 
-->

<body>
<div align="center">

<h1> My First Heading </h1>

<p> My <b>First</b> Paragraph! </p>

<!-- 
    Html has elements you can use to make text more interesting.
    The element used in the p tag above, the <b> tag, bolds words inside of the tag.

    A few other elements can be used as well such as:
    <i> (italics)
    <em> (emphasis, effect is also italics)
    <small> (smaller text)
    <mark> (highlight)
    <del> (deleted text, will appear marked through)
    <ins> (often used for inserted text, will appear underlined)
    

    Don't forget your closing tags!
-->


<!-- Note that the heading here is <h2> -->
<!-- <h2> is smaller than <h1> but larger than <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6> -->
<h2>My Second Heading</h2>


<!-- 
    What you will see right below is the <figure> tag.
    This is a container required for us to use 
    "figure captions", or captions, beneath our images.
    
    The tag for figure captions is <figcaption> as seen
    below within the <figure> container and below our
    img tags. 
    
    This is how we chose to use HTML to add
    Product Names and Prices below our images.

    *Optional: You could also remove the <figure></figure> container
                and house the Product Names and Prices within
                <p> (paragraph) tags as an alternative.

    <div style="display: inline-block;">
<!-- 
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are called attributes.

    The src attribute "points" to the image you want to use, whether by URL or by file path.
    Using the file path method means you need to select the folder from your "Explorer", then
    descend into that folder with a backslash (/), and then select the image you wish to use
    from that folder.

    The alt attribute, or "alt/alternative text", is used by screen readers for those that can't see the image, to briefly explain the image. It will also be seen in place of the image if the image isn't able to load.

    You can use the width and height attributes to resize your image, if desired.

    Replace the image name that's in quotes after src="assets/" with whichever of the provided
    images you prefer and have uploaded from the Google Drive Folder into the assets folder of
    this project. You can also resize the image by changing the width and height attributes.
